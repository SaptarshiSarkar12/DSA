# Search Algorithms

## What is searching?

Searching is the process of finding a specific element or value within a data structure. It is a fundamental operation in computer science and is often used in conjunction with data structures like arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

## Types of Search Algorithms

1. [**Linear Search**](linear_search): A simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found or the end of the list is reached.
2. [**Binary Search**](binary_search): An efficient search algorithm that follows the **divide-and-conquer** strategy to locate a target element within a sorted array, repeatedly halving the search space until the element is found (or confirmed absent).
