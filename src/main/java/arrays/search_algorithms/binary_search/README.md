# Binary Search

## What is Binary Search?

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element in a **sorted array**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half which significantly reduces the number of comparisons made.

## Questions

1. [**Ceiling of a number**](questions/Ceiling.java): You're given a sorted array in ascending order (suppose, `[2, 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 18]`. Let's say the target element is `15` and we will need to find the ceiling of that target number. This means we need to look for a number which is either equal to or greater than the target number.
2. [**Floor of a number**](questions/Floor.java): Similar to above one with the only difference being that we need to find the floor of the target number. This means we need to look for the greatest number smaller or equal to the target number.
