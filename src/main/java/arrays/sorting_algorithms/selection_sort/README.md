# Selection Sort

## What is Selection Sort?

Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted region. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or the largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the element present at the correct index of the earlier chosen element, effectively growing the sorted region one element at a time.
