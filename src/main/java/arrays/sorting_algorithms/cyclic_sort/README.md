# Cyclic Sort

## What is Cyclic Sort?

Cyclic Sort is an efficient sorting algorithm specifically designed for arrays containing a sequence of numbers within a known range, typically from 1 to n. The algorithm works by placing each number in its correct index position through a series of swaps, ensuring that each number is in the position corresponding to its value.
