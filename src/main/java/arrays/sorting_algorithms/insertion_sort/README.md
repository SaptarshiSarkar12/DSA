# Insertion Sort

## What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that builds a sorted array one element at a time. It works by dividing the array into a "sorted" and "unsorted" section. The algorithm iteratively takes an element from the unsorted section and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted section.
